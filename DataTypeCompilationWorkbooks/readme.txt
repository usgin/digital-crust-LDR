This directory contains:
Folders (Classes, Definitions, Links); these contain archival work from october 2016 on RDF implementation, and the Excel workbooks used to compile content for the data type representations; these are the active edit interfaces up thru June 2017.

Implementation Elements are not implemented currently, so there is only some initial work on that. Decided it was getting too deep.
