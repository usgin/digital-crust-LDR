This repository includes development work for a Data Type Registry for the NSF EarthCube Digital Crust and Data Discovery Hub projects. 
A prototype registry using the UK Linked Open data registry (https://github.com/UKGovLD/registry-core), was deployed for testing. 

**Update 2016-12-20**
We are now (2016-11) experimenting with the Cordra Data Type registry developed by CNRI and in testing by EUDAT (https://github.com/EUDAT-DTR/DTR).  The data type information model has been translated to a JSON Schema (v4) in DataTypeJSON.json, with a test instance document (JSONDataTypeTest.json).  

The information model for the registry is UML in an Enterprise Architect (EA) project file (DataTypeRegistryModel.eap), also dumped as a PDF generateding using EA reporting tools and some edit cleanup; the pdf is commonly out of sync with the EA model.

The registry tests have been implemented using content compiled in tables in spreadsheets for [data types defined by the USGIN Geothermal Data System](http://schemas.usgin.org/models/). 

**Current update 2016-12-20**
This process involves too much hand crafting, and we are now (2016-11) experimenting with the Cordra Data Type registry developed by CNRI and in testing by EUDAT (https://github.com/EUDAT-DTR/DTR).  The data type iniformation model has been translated to a JSON Schema (v4) in DataTypeJSON.json, with a test instance document (JSONDataTypeTest.json).
