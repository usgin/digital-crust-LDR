To create the skos:member list at the top of the ttl file:

In Notepad++ copy body to a new document and apply the following Find and Replace. Then copy the result back to the original file. There will be a small amount of cleanup left to do for the skos:member list.

Find what:

>( a skos:Concept.*?)^<

OR

>( a owl:Class.*?)^<

Replace with:

> ; \r  skos:member <


Turn on Regular Expression and check matches newline
